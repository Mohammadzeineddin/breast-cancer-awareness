        <p>Breast cancer occurs as a result of the increased and abnormal growth of breast cells. The cells divide and multiply at a faster rate than normal cell division in the body. These cells gather to form a mass of cancer cells. They may sometimes spread outside the breast and reach nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. And the truth is attributed.</p>

        <p>The second cause of breast cancer is the interaction between genetic and environmental factors together, and here it can be noted that there are a number of types of inherited genetic mutations that increase the chance of developing breast cancer and even the chance of developing ovarian cancer as well, the most prominent of which is the breast cancer gene 1, or BRCA1 for short. And the breast cancer geneBreast Cancer Gene 2, or BRCA2 for short.</p>
